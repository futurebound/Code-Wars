We were tasked to create a function that would accept a string of words as an argument, and then select the highest scoring word based on the following scoring system:
* Each letter is given a point value correlating to its number in the 26 letter alphabet
* Return the highest scoring word as a string
* If two words return the same score, return the word with an earlier position in the original string
