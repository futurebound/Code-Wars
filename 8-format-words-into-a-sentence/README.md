We've been tasked to create a function that accepts an array of strings. If the array is empty or contains null/nil values, it should return an empty string. Any empty strings in the array should be ignored when formatting the function, and after every word there should be added a comma except for the last two words, which should be separated by the word 'and' instead of a comma.
